RESPONSE:

Status | LID | Redirect URL | Price | Extra(0)  (see Vendor-API-LeadIntake, pipe | is delimiter)

When auto_redirect = 0 (normally this)

Accepted: e.g.  accepted|38sax8z|http://www.somesiteurl.com/thanx.aspx?tk=38sax8z&vid=38sx8dad&isac=LF0000|0|0
Error:    e.g.  error|38sax3z|Invalid Zip/State combination|0
Declined: e.g.  declined|38sax3z|We were unable to place your lead at this time|0

When auto_redirect = 1 (only for a simple html form post; URL would be placed in the form action)

Accepted: e.g. The applicant will automatically be redirected to a confirmation page.
Declined: e.g. Lead Flash will redirect the applicant to a declined page.
Error:    e.g. Lead Flash will redirect the applicant to a declined page.

NOTE: If you would like the applicant redirected back to your site, pass your URL in the declined_redirect field.

Or in XML by posting additional field called 'delimiter' = xml
The value for this field will be 'xml' (delimiter=xml), we will return the response as an XML string in the following format:

<lead_response>
<status>accepted</status>
<unique_id>To Be Issued</unique_id>
<message><![CDATA[http://www.redirectlinkhere.com]]></message>
<price>80</price>
<leadsourceid>0</leadsourceid>
</lead_response>

======================================================================

Lid           (pass by LeadFlash first)
test_app      (1=test, 0=live)
